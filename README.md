## Explanation

Most of us leave our keys in the hallway of our house, which is a short distance away from the car. Thieves use special equipment to boost the signal from your car's keyless entry fob so it can reach your car and unlock it. This trick works even if you keep your keys in a room on the opposite side of your house.

A common solution to this problem is to keep your keys in a specially designed "farraday box" or pouch which blocks the signal, but this doesn't work well for many. You could forget to put the keys there, or not want to spend the time searching for two sets of keys every night. Pouches can also fail to work after some time.

There are also other more elaborate devices to solve the problem, but they often carry a significant cost.

This page explains the official methods that your car manufacturer designed to prevent thieves carrying out signal boosting to steal your car.
