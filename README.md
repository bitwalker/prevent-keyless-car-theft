## Explanation

Most of us leave our keys in the hallway of our house, which is a short distance away from our car. Thieves use special equipment to boost the signal from your car's keyless entry fob so it can reach your car and unlock it. They can even do this if you keep your keys in a room on the opposite side of your house.

A common solution to this problem is to keep your keys in a specially designed "faraday box" or pouch which blocks the signal, but this doesn't work well for many. You could forget to put the keys there, or not want to spend the time and money. Pouches can also fail to work after some time. People may also use tin foil, but it's still a bit of a faff.

There are other more elaborate devices to solve the problem, but they often carry a significant cost.

This page explains the official methods that your car manufacturer designed to prevent thieves carrying out signal boosting to steal your car.
